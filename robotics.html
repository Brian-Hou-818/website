            <h2>Journey of Robotic Discovery: Igniting Passion and Curiosity</h2>
            <br>
            <p>
                My interest in robotics started early, sparked by a decision my parents made that I couldn’t have appreciated at the time—enrolling me in LEGO Mindstorms EV3 lessons. What began as a fun after-school activity quickly turned into something much more. I was introduced to a world where creativity met engineering, and where lines of code and spinning gears could bring ideas to life. The ability to build something tangible from my imagination completely hooked me. That early exposure didn’t just teach me technical skills; it ignited a lasting curiosity and excitement for problem-solving that continues to shape my path today.

            <h2>3-DoF Robotic Arm</h2>
            <br>
            <p>
                As part of the MET 348 Robot Kinematics class at Purdue University, I opted to design and build a fully articulative 3-DOF robotic arm for the final project. This hands-on experience allowed me to apply theoretical concepts from class, such as forward and inverse kinematics, workspace analysis, and joint coordination, to a tangible system. I was responsible for CADing, configuring servo motors, and programming the arm to execute precise movements, which reinforced my understanding of mechanical design principles and control strategies. The project not only enhanced my technical skills but also strengthened my problem-solving abilities, as I had to iteratively test, troubleshoot, and refine the arm to achieve smooth and accurate operation.</p>

            <h2>VexU - PYRO's revival: <i>Air Blast</i></h2>
            <br>
            <p>
                In 2022, my journey with VexU began as I gained acceptance into Arizona State University (ASU). While
                reminiscing about the past, I discovered that the once illustrious team, PYRO, had faced setbacks during
                the tumultuous times of the COVID-19 pandemic. With a deep-rooted desire to reignite the team's former
                glory and achieve the coveted title of Vex world champion, I eagerly joined their ranks.
            </p>
            <p>
                The season of "Spin Up" in 2022-2023 became an opportunity for me to breathe life back into PYRO and
                make our mark on the Vex landscape once again. Through relentless dedication and innovation, I
                meticulously crafted a one-of-a-kind robot known as the Air Blast. This creation garnered unwavering
                admiration from the judges at the tournament, leaving them in awe of its ingenuity. In fact, the
                esteemed head of the game development committee even declared it as his "favorite robot of all time."
            </p>
            <p>
                The ripple effect of Air Blast's success spread far and wide, resonating with teams across the globe.
                The resoundingly positive feedback received from these teams, including high school students who shared
                a passion for Vex, was truly inspiring. Remarkably, the impact was so profound that some aspiring
                individuals expressed their desire to join ASU solely based on the extraordinary robot I had designed
                and built.
            </p>
            <p>
                To further validate the greatness of Air Blast, it proudly clinched the prestigious Build Award, the
                highest honor bestowed upon a meticulously crafted robot, at the world championship event. This accolade
                served as a testament to the vision and craftsmanship that breathed life into Air Blast, solidifying its
                place in Vex history.
            </p>
            <p>
                With one purpose accomplished and the team's resurgence well underway, I am more determined than ever to
                strive toward the ultimate goal of claiming the title of Vex world champion. This remarkable journey has
                not only reaffirmed my commitment to PYRO but also ignited a passion within others, leaving an indelible
                impact on the Vex community as a whole.

            <h2>Vex VRC - Ignite: Pioneering the Path of Robotics Excellence</h2>
            <br>
            <p>
                Vex robotics has been an integral part of my life since my sophomore year of high school, marking a
                serendipitous encounter during my transition from Fuhsing Private School (FHJH) to Kang Chiao
                International School (KCIS). FHJH served as the gateway that initially introduced me to the captivating
                realm of competitive robotics.
            </p>
            <p>
                My journey began with two immersive years in the FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC) during my middle
                school days, although I must admit that the intricacies of FRC posed a significant challenge at the
                time. Nonetheless, it was through my involvement in FRC that I first discovered the closely intertwined
                world of Vex robotics. However, to my chagrin, I soon realized that KCIS exclusively offered Vex to
                junior and senior students.
            </p>
            <p>
                Determined not to let timing hinder my passion, I embarked on a mission to establish a robotics program
                at KCIS, designed specifically for freshmen. Recognizing that it would be a missed opportunity to wait
                until my last two years of high school, I endeavored to create a pathway for students to delve into the
                wonders of robotics right from the outset of their freshman year.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, embarking on a new program holds little meaning unless accompanied by compelling results. In a
                remarkable display of skill and determination, our nascent team triumphed at our inaugural competition,
                seizing the coveted Amaze Award—an accolade bestowed upon teams that exhibit extraordinary performance,
                versatility, and overall excellence. This momentous achievement marked a historic milestone for KCIS, as
                no team had ever secured any recognition before.
            </p>
            <p>
                The momentum of our success continued to surge throughout the season, propelling us to claim the title
                of national champions. This resounding victory also earned KCIS its first-ever qualification for the
                World Championship, solidifying our team's position as trailblazers within our school's proud history.
                To this day, our record remains unbroken.
            </p>
            <p>
                By etching our names into the illustrious history of KCIS, our accomplishments not only left an
                indelible mark but also ignited a spark of inspiration within future generations of robotics
                enthusiasts, compelling them to strive for greatness. Embracing the responsibility to foster the ongoing
                success of our school, I took the initiative to establish a Discord server—an interactive platform
                designed to facilitate communication and knowledge sharing among incoming students with a passion for
                robotics. This virtual space serves as a haven where inquisitive minds can seek guidance, pose
                questions, and engage in meaningful discussions with experienced competitors from previous years.
            </p>
            <p>
                The impact of this Discord server has surpassed all expectations, paving the way for the emergence of a
                new wave of accomplished KCIS Robotics participants. As these aspiring individuals leverage the
                collective wisdom and experience available to them, they embark on their own remarkable journeys,
                achieving commendable success and upholding the proud legacy of our school's robotics program.
